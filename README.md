# Tinker-Campus-Thrift

We have developed a web-based application *Campus Thrift* which is a platform dedicated to buying and selling items within the campus community. Our goal is to facilitate easy transactions and promote sustainability by giving items a second life. This is a web-based application that functions as a medium to buy and sell second hand academic goods such as books, instruments, lab uniforms, notebooks etc.

## Problem Statement: 
**Campus Thrift - Online Platform for Campus Trading**

### Problem Background:
Campuses have an ecosystem of buying, selling, and trading various items among students and faculty. However, coordinating these transactions efficiently can be challenging, leading to missed opportunities and inconvenience for participants. To address this, Campus Thrift aims to provide a user-friendly online platform specifically tailored for academic goods trading.

### Objective:
The objective of Campus Thrift is to create a centralized online marketplace where members of a campus community can easily buy and sell items with each other. The platform should facilitate smooth transactions and enhance convenience.
