# Tinker-Campus-Thrift
We have developed a web-based application *Campus Thrift* which is a platform dedicated to buying and selling items within the campus community. Our goal is to facilitate easy transactions and promote sustainability by giving items a second life. This is a web-based application that functions as a medium to buy and sell second hand academic goods such as books, instruments, lab uniforms, notebooks etc
